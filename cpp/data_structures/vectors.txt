erase()	Removes a number of elements from a vector

front()	Returns the first element of a vector

insert()	Inserts a number of elements into a vector

max_size()	Returns the maximum number of elements that a vector can have

pop_back()	Removes the last element of a vector

push_back()	Adds an element to the end of a vector

rbegin()	Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element of a vector

rend()	Returns a reverse iterator pointing to a position right before the first element of a vector

reserve()	Reserves memory for a vector

resize()	Changes the size of a vector, adding or removing elements if necessary

shrink_to_fit()	Reduces the reseved memory of a vector if necessary to exactly fit the number of elements
